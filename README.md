# Getting Started
To get started with the course, download or clone the repo in your Jupyter Lab.

Once you have the repo folder in your Jupyter Lab, it's best to go through the notebooks in numeric order. Many of the notebooks contain interactive exercises. Once you complete the exercises, you can check your answers against the answers stored in the `/answers` folder.
