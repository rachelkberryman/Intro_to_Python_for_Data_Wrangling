    "# Scripting Exercise: Creating an automatic report\n",
    "In the course up to now, we've learned about how we can use native python techniques (functions, if/else statements, conditionals, etc) together with data processing libraries like Pandas, to clean, transorm, and analyze data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we practice using these tools and see how they can be used to improve processes by automating tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scripting in python\n",
    "Remember that we can run python in two ways: in *scripting mode*, or in *interactive mode*.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run code in a notebook cell, we are running code in interactive mode. This is great when we want an immediate output, and when we want to see how our code works and check that it is working properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we want to create a program that we can use to repeatedly complete repetetive tasks, it's best to use python in script mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we package our code up into a .py file, and run it from the command line. When we do so, our entire file will run, not just individual lines. This is very powerful as it makes executing code for repetitive tasks very easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moving code into a script\n",
    "When developing a script for the first time, it can be helpful to first write and check your code in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by moving more and more of your code into one cell. Check where your code is running in the notebook with the command `!pwd`. Think about if this is also where you would want your script to run from.\n"

    "### Our scripting task\n",
    "We will build on the work we did in notebook number 7. Real-world Data Practice, and also use the same liquor store dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine you are working for the state of Iowa's Liquor Authority, and you need to make a monthly report with some key facts. Up until now, you have been manually following a list of prescribed protocols to generate the report by hand every month. It generally takes you about half a day once every month to generate this report. The steps are essentially the same every month: you have to filter the data for the month in question, complete some data cleaning steps, and calculate the necessary KPIs. Since you do this manually, there are often occassionally errors. To help make sure the report contains as few errors as possible, you also send the report every month to your colleague to do some sanity checks. This also takes 1 hour of your colleague's time. This means that in total, you and your colleague spend 5 hours every month on preparing the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The benefit of scripting for repetetive tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "You tallk with your boss and decide to use your python skills to automate this task using a script. You and your boss estimate that it will take you about 10 hours to write the script, sicne you are still new to Python and it will take you time to debug the code. Once the script is written, it will take you 1 minute to run it each month. This means that after 2 months, having the script will have 'paid for itself' in terms of time saved, you will have sharpened your Python skills, and you and your colleage will now have a combined 5 hours more time each week to devote to other tasks. \n",
